# Google Willow Chip: Quantum Error Correction and Real-Time Decoding

This project explores the principles, simulation techniques, and engineering implementation of **quantum error correction (QEC)** through the case study of Google's **Willow chip**, the first system to demonstrate real logical error rate suppression using **surface code**.

## 98 Project Overview

Quantum computing promises unprecedented computational power, but **quantum bits (qubits)** are fragile and easily disturbed by noise and decoherence. **Quantum Error Correction (QEC)** encodes logical qubits into multiple physical qubits to detect and correct errors without disturbing quantum information.

In 2023, **Google's Willow chip** demonstrated:
- A 105-qubit superconducting processor with distance-7 surface code
- Logical qubit lifetime exceeding physical ones by 2.4×
- Hardware-accelerated real-time decoding using **Fusion Blossom**

This project aims to both understand and simulate QEC workflows, and evaluate Willow’s engineering innovations.

## 93 Objectives

1. **Theoretical Understanding**  
   Learn how QEC works using **repetition and phase-flip codes**, exploring stabilizers, logical qubits, and surface codes.

2. **Simulation Practice**  
   Implement and test QEC pipelines using Python with:
   - `QuTiP` for quantum state simulation
   - `PyMatching` for MWPM decoding
   - `Fusion Blossom` for real-time, hardware-friendly decoding

3. **Case Study Analysis**  
   Investigate the Willow chip’s design, error suppression results, and decoding architecture.
